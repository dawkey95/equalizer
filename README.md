## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) - Icon library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project although not heavy with JS was just good practice around HTML and CSS to create the landing apge. I also used this project to practice using Tailwind CSS and Next.js. I also used this project to practice using React Icons.

### Continued development

Going forward with future projects I want to continue learning NextJS 13.3 as well as getting more component with Tailwind CSS. I also want to focus on devling more into React with future prohects that will start to rely more on JS.
